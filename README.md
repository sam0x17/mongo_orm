# Mongo ORM
This shard provides a basic ORM for using MongoDB wth the Crystal programming language.
Mongo ORM is based on [Granite ORM](https://github.com/amberframework/granite-orm),
and provides basic querying, associations, and model lifecycle capabilities. Mongo ORM
is intended to be used with the [Amber Framework](https://github.com/amberframework/amber),
but can be used with vanilla crystal or any web framework.

Suggestions, feature requests, bug fixes, and pull requests are always welcome.

## Installation
First you will need to [install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.4/administration/install-community/)
(unless you are running a remote server), as well as the dependencies for
[Mongo.cr](https://github.com/datanoise/mongo.cr). On Arch Linux and Ubuntu,
this can be done using your package manager as shown below. For other linux distrubutions, you may be able
to use the script shown below.

#### Arch Linux:

Simply run:

```
$ sudo pacman -Syu libbson mongodb
$ sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

#### Ubuntu

Simply run:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sudo apt install libmongoc-dev libmongoc-1.0-0 libmongoclient-dev
```

#### Other Linux:

Simply run `./install_linux_deps`, the contents of which are shown below:

```bash
# install_linux_deps.sh
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p lib || exit 1
cd lib || exit 1
wget https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/download/1.1.0/mongo-c-driver-1.1.0.tar.gz || exit 1
tar -zxvf mongo-c-driver-1.1.0.tar.gz && cd mongo-c-driver-1.1.0/ || exit 1
./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib || exit 1
make -j4 || exit 1
sudo make install -j4 || exit 1
```

#### MacOS:
You can just run `./install_macos_deps`, the contents of which are shown below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -LO https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/download/1.9.4/mongo-c-driver-1.9.4.tar.gz || exit 1
tar xzf mongo-c-driver-1.9.4.tar.gz || exit 1
cd mongo-c-driver-1.9.4 || exit 1
./configure || exit 1
make || exit 1
sudo make install || exit 1
```


Next, add the following to the `shard.yml` file in your project and run `shards install`:
```yml
# shard.yml
dependencies:
  mongo_orm:
    github: sam0x17/mongo_orm
```

## Establishing MongoDB Connection
By default (with zero configuration), Mongo ORM will attempt to connect to a database
running at `localhost:27017` which is the default MongoDB port, with the database
name `monogo_orm_db`.

### Using Environment Variables
If the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` is present, Mongo ORM will connect using
this variable instead. You can also specify the database name using the `DATABASE_NAME`
environment variable. For example:

```
$ DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:11771;DATABASE_NAME=my_db crystal app.cr
```

### Using a YAML Configuration File
If the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not present, Mongo ORM will look for the
file `config/database.yml` within your project directory. If the file exists, Mongo
ORM will expect the following format (specify the keys `database_url` and
`database_name`):

```yaml
# config/database.yml
database_url: mongodb://localhost:11771
database_name: my_db
```

## Mongo ORM Reference

### Static Fields
MongoDB is different from conventional relational database systems mainly because there
is no set-in-stone schema, but instead a wilderness of BSON-based "documents" that
may or may not roughly follow the same schema. Declaring static fields works much the
same as it does in Granite ORM:

```crystal
require "mongo_orm"

class User < Mongo::ORM::Document
  field name : String
  field age : Int32
  field deleted_at : Time
  field turned_on : Bool
  timestamps
end
```

This will declare a model called `User` with a string field called `name`, a 32-bit
integer field called `age`, a Time field called `deleted_at`, a boolean field called
`turned_on`, and the standard `created_at` and `updated_at` fields you will recognize
from Rails that are created because we specified `timestamps`.

Note: all Time fields are presently locked into UTC because of some conversion bugs
that arise when changing time zones and converting between BSON and crystal models.

To instantiate a `User` and save it to the database, you can do:

```crystal
user = User.new
user.name = "Sam"
user.age = 248
user.turned_on = true
user.save!
puts user.inspect # print the created user
puts "id: #{user._id}" # print the ID of the created user
```
Note that the `ID` field is named `_id`, as in standard MongoDB.

You can also use the more compact `create` notation:

```crystal
user = User.create name: "Sam", age: 248, turned_on: true
```

### Model Associations
Currently, you can define `has_many` associations directly on a model, and they will
behave roughly the same way they would in standard Rails. For example:

```crystal
class Group < Mongo::ORM::Document
  field name : String
  has_many :users
end
```
This defines another model called `Group`. A group has a String field `name`, and
has an ID-based collection of `User` documents called `users` which can be accessed
via `group.users` where `group` is an instance of `Group`. To make a `User` a member
of a `Group`, `user.group_id` can be set to the document ID of an already-created
`Group`. Note that when you specify that model A `has_many` model B, the `b.a_id` field
is also automatically created.

### Embedded Documents
In addition to conventional table-style models/documents, Mongo ORM supports the
ability to embed documents or collections of documents within documents, as per the
BSON standard. This is sometimes a more convenient or more efficient alternative
to spreading data out across multiple document collections (tables) and fully leverages
the document-based nature of MongoDB. Note that you can also nest embedded documents.
See the example below:

```crystal
class Topic < Mongo::ORM::Document
  embeds top_comment : Comment # e.g. topic.top_comment.body
end

class Tag < Mongo::ORM::EmbeddedDocument
  field topic : String
end

class Comment < Mongo::ORM::EmbeddedDocument
  field body : String
  embeds_many :tags # e.g. comment.tags[0]
end
```

### Extended Fields
Mongo ORM also allows you to make use of document fields that are not specified
explicitly in the model schema. In fact, it is possible to use Mongo ORM without
specifying any model schema at all, however we have provided both options, as schemas
provide sane defaults, type checking, and consistency, whereas extended fields (our
name for fields not specified in a model schema) make it easy to do dynamic things
that would be difficult or impossible in traditional relational databases, and require
zero configuration.

For example, suppose you have an `Admin` collection in your database, and that some
(but not all) `Admin` documents have a field called `alias`:

```crystal
admin = Admin.find(4)
puts admin.alias
```
If the document does indeed have a field named `alias`, then this will print
its value. If such a field is not defined, then `nil` (nothing) will be printed. This
will also work on nested documents, for example `blog.header.tag` where `blog` is a
`Blog` document and `header` is a `Header` embedded document.

If you know for a fact that `alias` should be defined on this particular document,
you can use the following syntax to be more explicit:

```crystal
admin = Admin.find(4)
puts admin.alias!
```

The `!` syntax will cause an error to be thrown (undefined method) in the event that
the `alias` field is not defined.
